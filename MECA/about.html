              Mighty Eagle’s College, Accra, stands today as a symbol of educational growth, resilience, and transformation. Over the years, the institution has evolved through several phases—beginning as the Professional School of Studies, later becoming Lister Professional Institute, then Lister Educational Institute, and finally rebranding into what is now known as Mighty Eagle’s College, Accra. Each transformation marked a new era of innovation, expansion, and commitment to providing quality education that meets Ghana’s changing academic and professional demands.
              The college was founded with a clear mission: to create an environment where students could develop academically, professionally, and personally. From humble beginnings, it has grown into a fully registered and recognized educational institution in Ghana, operating under accreditation standards set by relevant educational authorities. This official registration has allowed the college to operate confidently and transparently, ensuring that every programme offered aligns with national standards and professional expectations.
              Today, Mighty Eagle’s College offers a rich variety of academic and professional programmes that blend theoretical learning with practical skills. These include Fashion and Design Technology, Accounting, Public Relations, Business Administration, Cosmetology, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT)—each designed to prepare students for real-world challenges and equip them with employable skills. The college’s curriculum also includes Introduction to Languages (English and French) to enhance students’ communication and international competence. Every programme is designed to promote creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship, ensuring that graduates are academically sound, career-ready, and capable of contributing meaningfully to society.
              Mighty Eagle’s College is proud of its long-standing tradition of excellence and its impact on students’ lives. Its success is reflected in the achievements of its alumni, who continue to make significant contributions in business, education, media, and other sectors. The institution’s strength lies in its dedicated faculty, modern teaching methods, and a supportive learning environment that encourages discipline, confidence, and critical thinking.
              This remarkable journey—from the Professional School of Studies through the Lister eras to the emergence of Mighty Eagle’s College—tells a story of vision, growth, and commitment. The following sections trace this transformation step by step, highlighting how each phase built the foundation for what the college represents today: a modern, forward-looking institution devoted to shaping the minds and futures of Ghana’s next generation.

                The Early Foundation: Professional School of Studies
              </strong> <br>
              The roots of Mighty Eagle’s College trace back to July 2007, when it began as the Professional School of Studies. Founded in the heart of Madina–Accra, this small educational centre was established to provide accessible and practical education to students who had limited opportunities to pursue tertiary studies due to academic or financial constraints.
              The institution was officially registered on 11th December 2008 under the Technical Examinations Unit of the Ghana Education Service (GES–DBS) with just 12 students, all of whom achieved a 100% pass rate in the first Diploma in Business Studies (DBS) examinations. The school began with business-focused courses such as Diploma in Accounting, Marketing, and Business Studies, providing solid foundations in business education.
              By the 2012/2013 academic year, the institution successfully transitioned from the Diploma in Business Studies (DBS) framework to the General Business Certificate Examination (GBCE) and Advanced Business Certificate Examination (ABCE) programmes, expanding its curriculum and aligning with the national examination standards. This pivotal shift strengthened its academic reputation and laid the groundwork for its future growth.

              <strong class="fw mb-5 text-primary">
                The Growth and Transformation: Lister Professional Institute
              </strong> <br>
              On 30th November 2009, the institution officially changed its name to Lister Professional Institute (LPI), signifying a new chapter of professionalism, academic structure, and expansion. This rebranding reflected the institution’s growth and renewed focus on delivering career-oriented education that blended business theory with practical skills.
              Under this name, the institution introduced advanced subjects under its Business Administration programme, including Business Finance, Economics, Business Commerce, and Accounting as part of the GBCE curriculum. It also expanded its offerings to include Professional and Remedial Entry Programmes, enabling students to prepare for university and professional examinations.
              The Lister Professional Institute era marked a period of stability, improvement, and success. The school became widely known for producing well-trained, disciplined students and achieved impressive results in national business examinations. LPI established itself as one of the leading professional training centres in Accra, setting a new standard for private education.

              <strong class="fw mb-5 text-primary">
                Modernization and Expansion: Lister Educational Institute
              </strong> <br>
              After a decade of operation under LPI, the management rebranded the institution as Lister Educational Institute on 15th December 2020. This rebrand signaled modernization and a broadened educational scope that embraced creativity, technology, and 21st-century learning methods.
              During this period, the institution also expanded geographically with the establishment of a Kumasi branch (Adeibi Campus) in the early 2020s, extending its services beyond Greater Accra to the Ashanti Region. The campus focused on providing the same quality of education while serving students in central Ghana.
              The Lister Educational Institute era saw an enriched curriculum offering Diplomas and Advanced Diplomas in Accounting, Business Administration, and Information Technology. It also introduced new short courses in Entrepreneurship, Graphic Design, Fashion and Design, and Office Management—equipping learners with relevant skills for both employment and self-reliance.

                A New Dawn: Mighty Eagle’s College, Accra (2025 – Present)
              </strong> <br>
              On 9th September 2025, the institution entered its newest chapter, officially changing its name to Mighty Eagle’s College, Accra. This rebranding, duly registered and incorporated under the Companies Act, 1963 (Act 179) as a Limited Company by the Registrar of Companies, symbolizes vision, strength, and progress.
              This transformation reflects the college’s renewed mission to deliver inclusive, modern, and globally relevant education. In addition to its strong foundation in business and professional training, the college has expanded into diverse academic and technical disciplines.
              New programmes introduced include:
              <ul>
                <li>Public Relations and Communication Studies</li>
                <li>Cosmetology and Beauty Therapy</li>
                <li>Fashion Design Technology</li>

              These courses complement existing programmes in Business Administration, Accounting, and Marketing, creating a well-rounded academic portfolio that meets modern career and industry demands.
              The rebrand to Mighty Eagle’s College represents the institution’s unwavering commitment to excellence, innovation, and empowerment. The college continues to nurture future leaders—instilling in them the confidence and skills to soar high, just as the eagle rises above challenges with vision and strength.
